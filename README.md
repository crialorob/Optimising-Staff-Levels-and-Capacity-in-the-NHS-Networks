Optimising Staff Levels and Capacity in the NHS Networks & Identifying trends in the utilisation of resources over time

Diagnostic Analysis using Python

SCENARIO 

The NHS incurs in significant, potentially avoidable, costs when patients miss general practitioner (GP) appointments.

Why should the NHS try and solve this problem?

While it is frustrating when patients do not attend, the reasons why this happens should be investigated rather than simply resorting to punishing patients.
Financially penalising patients inevitably impact the poorest and most vulnerable in the community.
Therefore, reducing or eliminating missed appointments would be beneficial financially as well as socially for the entire community.

I will be working with real-world data to address a problem faced by the National Health Service (NHS). I'll utilise Python to explore the available data, create visualisations to identify trends, and extract meaningful insights to inform decision-making.
